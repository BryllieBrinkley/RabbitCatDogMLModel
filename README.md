## RabbitCatDogMLModel

* A trained machine learning model (trained using Apple's CreateML API)
* Use the .mlmodel file to integrate the model into your own Xcode project. 
* 99% accurate in identifying pictures of Cats, Dogs, and Rabbits.

Through developing this app, I gained and solidified knowledge in various learning topics, including...

* Using CreateML to train machine learning models.
* Every step of creating a artificially intelligent image recognition machine learning algorithm
* How to gather and label data for training

## Installation & How to Run To run this project, make sure you have Xcode on your machine and follow these steps:

Download the '.mlmodel' file to incorporate into your Xcode project.
